      <p className="text-base font-normal">
        Beyond coding, I`m a 4th-semester Information Systems student at
        Gunadarma University, always excited to explore new tech and push the
        web forward. Whether it`s experimenting with UI/UX trends, optimizing
        performance, or tinkering with new frameworks, I`m all about learning
        and improving.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-base font-normal">
        When I`m not deep in code, you`ll probably find me geeking out over the
        latest tech innovations, sipping on a good cup of coffee ☕, or
        brainstorming new side projects. For me, technology isn`t just about
        functionality—it`s about creating experiences that delight and inspire.
